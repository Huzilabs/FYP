# Copy this to `.env` and fill in the values. Do NOT commit your real .env to version control.
# SUPABASE_URL: your Supabase project URL (found in Project Settings → API)
# SUPABASE_KEY: your Supabase API key (either anon key for client usage or service_role for server scripts)

SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-service-role-or-anon-key

# Notes:
# - For server-side scripts (e.g. uploading embeddings, manipulating tables), using the "service_role" key is
#   convenient because it has elevated privileges. Treat the service_role key like a secret and keep it on the server
#   or in CI secrets; do not embed it into client-side code.
# - For client-side usage (web apps), use the anon key.
# - The db helper in this repo expects these env vars to be present for Supabase mode.
